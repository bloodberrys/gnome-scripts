[ffebad] The sea monster, the ominous aura really comes from it... Saventra, I felt it suddenly appeared in the port, and I really can't figure out how it came back to life. You can't deal with that monster, I... have to let me deal with him...[-]

[ffebad] Saventra? Is this the name of the sea monster... Geraint, you can't go! You are covered in bruises, it is hard to say whether you can move around freely! Please teach me how to fight it, let me do it! [-]

[ffebad] You are a reliable comrade in arms, but that monster is definitely not something humans can fight against... I need to recover a little strength as soon as possible, so as to ensure that the lair is still safe after I leave. Go to [0096ff] Time Forgotten Ruins[-] as soon as possible to find some medicine from the elves, and help me recover more...[-]

[ffebad] I brought back the herbs, Geraint, can these heal your wounds? [-]

[ffebad] Heh, friend, I understand what you mean, but in fact, these medicinal materials have little recovery effect, and more of an analgesic effect. With these medicines, I should still be able to use my strength...but I can't see at all, so I must rely on your help this time. [-]
