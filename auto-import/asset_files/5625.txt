[ffebad] Adventurer, do you know the story of a great goddess? [-]
0
[ffebad] I know that the continent of Altria was created by the great goddess Althea, and it seems that there is also the evil goddess Vestine. [-]
1
[ffebad] That's right, the two goddesses are actually sisters. I found the research books of the ancient dark priestess. You must not spread the secrets mentioned below. [-]

[ffebad] Legend has it that Desmodeus, the father of the gods, asked his two daughters to create the world, the goddess Althea created our continent of Altria, and the goddess Vestine created the continent of mystery. Desmodeus praises Althea, and Vestine is jealous. [-]
1
[ffebad] Vestine used the poison of corruption to make Goddess Althea fall into a coma. Originally, our world was about to be destroyed, but Desmodeus got angry, so Vestine had to flee to the Lost Continent to hide. The evil goddess couldn't leave her own world, so she created a shadow dragon to invade the continent. [-]
