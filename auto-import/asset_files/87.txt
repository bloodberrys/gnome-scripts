[ffebad] Lord Karaqiu, Sidel is immersed in hatred, do you want to dissuade him? [-]
1
[ffebad] Sydell was a great kid, but he never had enough motivation. Callahan's goal will make Siddell grow a lot, let him calm down. Besides, I won't let Callahan go. [-]

[ffebad] However, you mentioned Bethkind, now it's time to find out why he's here, if he joins forces with Callahan...[-]

[ffebad] The direction Beth Keld left seems to be [0096ff] the east of the ancient armory[-]. I went to him and asked him about his purpose. [-]

[ffebad] Hehe, I've caught up with you, have you found Callahan? [-]
1
[ffebad] let him escape, but that's okay, the dragon's gems are not so easy to absorb. Before he summoned enough power to awaken the Green Dragon Jade, he would definitely appear again. [-]

[ffebad] Bethkind, are you willing to fight for the good people and destroy Callahan with us? [-]
1
[ffebad] Ridiculous, do you know what is good and what is evil? Like I said, I'm only doing it for myself. However, the follower of the dragon is already my mortal enemy. [-]

[ffebad] Followers of the Dragon, is Ignacio's organization? You said that Elena is an apostle like him, are they all followers of the dragon? [-]
1
[ffebad] Followers of the Dragon is an organization formed by that man's followers. The so-called apostles, whether it is Elena, Ignacio, Callahan, Typhoon Jin, or me in the past, are just that man's Seven retainers. It's funny that I haven't seen it clearly, he is not worth following at all...[-]

[ffebad] Is his goal the Dragon Jewel? [-]
1
[ffebad] Of course, he already has a Dragon Orb, but he's still coveting others. The ridiculous thing is that after we won the precious jade, we took it all for ourselves. [-]
1
[ffebad] Callahan, this time he obviously wants to absorb the Green Dragon Jade himself. But he is really a genius, without the power of the ancients, he has a way... [-]

[ffebad] said too much without realizing it. Little boy, this is out of reach for you, I'm going to track Callahan, you'd better find a safe place to hide. [-]
