[ffebad] Is it the undead thing? [-]

[ffebad] Adventurer, you are also very well informed. That's right, alas, it was a soldier of our church who touched the seal of an ancient relic while chasing down those followers of the dragon. Unexpectedly, a large number of undead ran out from there, and we had to send troops to suppress it. [-]

[ffebad] I will go to the front line myself, adventurer, you have another mission! The magic crystal that guards the sacred heaven has been invaded by a small wave of undead. It is a forbidden area, which can only be guarded by the strong, and no large army can be sent. Can you destroy the undead who destroy the guardian crystal? [-]
0
[ffebad] Guaranteed to complete the task, His Excellency. [-]
