[ffebad] Hehe, nice to meet you. I am ashamed to say that when I was escaping from myself, I was captured by the followers of the dragon, and it was Lord Tramayi who rescued me. He advised me not to give up, and has been taking good care of me. [-]

[ffebad] During this period of time, everyone has suffered so much for me, I must repay everyone, I, I will work hard. From the dream of the goddess, I can see some vague future, Barna is now...well, he is near the Swamp of the Lost. [-]

[ffebad] I originally thought that it would be possible to purify the evil thoughts on Barna... Now it seems that it will not be very simple. During the battle of the black dragon, I was lucky enough not to be injured, but Nervin, Karaqiu and Barna were all contaminated by the blood of the black dragon. [-]

[ffebad] Nelvin went to Anu Aland, the hometown of the elves, Karaqiu was recuperating in the Lotus Swamp, and Barna went to Tanumara to find a cure, but unexpectedly, he died there in the end. I got his news and wanted to see him for the last time, but I still missed it. [-]

[ffebad] Then on the way back, I found a girl surrounded by followers of the dragon. After she was awakened, she said a lot about the followers of the dragon. When all these news came true, I knew she was the prophet. It was also the power of the prophet that let me know the news that Barna could not rest in peace. [-]

[ffebad] Barna gave everything for the sake of the world, eliminated all kinds of disasters countless times, and finally died and couldn't rest in peace. He must be rescued! Fortunately, the Prophet is by our side, which must be a gift from the Goddess. [-]
