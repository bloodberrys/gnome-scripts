[ffebad]Adventurer, do you know what dragons exist? Do you know the origin of the dragon? [-]

[ffebad]I know Argenta is a silver dragon and Geraint is a gold dragon, they are helping us. There are also black dragons, green dragons, and desert dragons... But Geraint never told me about the origin of the dragons. [-]

[ffebad]All I see is the story of the dragon. Legend has it that the goddess created a powerful chaotic dragon and an ancient dragon to guard the world. The evil goddess Vestine created a shadow dragon to invade the world. After the battle of the three dragons, the ancient dragon fell and its power was divided into two. A golden dragon and a silver dragon were born. [-]

[ffebad]The Chaos Dragon was eroded by the Shadow Dragon's power during the battle. After it fell, it left seven descendants. Unfortunately, the specific dragons are not recorded here. The descendants of Chaos Dragon are not crazy, but they act completely according to their own preferences, which is very dangerous. Even the dragon jade after death will be sealed up. [-]
1
[ffebad]As for the black dragon, it is only recorded here that it is the product of the ancient people's research on the power of the shadow dragon, and it is the source of complete destruction. [-]

[ffebad]It's really a huge epic, it's really insightful. [-]

[ffebad]Hey, I know more than that! Come on, you go back with a gift, next time I will sort out a new story, and I will ask you to share it together. [-]
