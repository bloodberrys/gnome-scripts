[ffebad] Come inside and listen to me... Well, after the last war, the black dragon fell off a cliff and we all thought he was going to die. But not long ago I heard Jinlong say that the black dragon didn't actually die, but just hid. This, this... If he appears again, I don't know how big a storm will be caused! [-]

[ffebad] I didn't dare to tell anyone about this news, and I didn't dare to send people to search, just because I was afraid of causing panic among everyone. Can you go to the [0096ff] Dark Territory Canyon [-] where the black dragon fell, and look around to see if there are any traces of him? [-]

[ffebad] Thank you for trusting me so much. This is indeed a great hidden danger... I will investigate secretly. [-]

[ffebad] Archbishop, look what I found! The wings dropped by the black dragon! But no trace of the black dragon was found. [-]

[ffebad] Hush! Don't let others hear it! It's a pity that there are only wings, and the life and death of the black dragon cannot be determined... I sincerely hope that the black dragon can just disappear. This black dragon's wing is a tricky thing, and you were quite right in bringing it to me. Left alone, its sinister aura would obviously harm civilians. [-]

[ffebad] Give it to me and I'll do my best to purify it. Thank you so much, little hero. [-]
