[ffebad]Hope he can change his ways. Warrior, we have more urgent matters now. Since the Green Dragon incident, the activities of the followers of the dragon have become more and more rampant. Recently, the traitor Ignacio has also been exposed. He seems to be planning some evil activities. I would like to ask you to go to the Full Moon Desert to investigate to see if he really appeared.

[ffebad]No, the enemy is in the dark and we are in the light. If the army is dispatched, it is easy to scare the snake. It's better to be on the safe side, let the strong first investigate their purpose and where they are going. I will do it myself, please go find Beth Keld, and just test him. [-]
