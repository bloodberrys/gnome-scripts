[ffebad]I also heard about someone missing. It turned out that Chati hated the teacher because of this. What can I do, the teacher will definitely not do bad things, someone must be sowing discord! [-]

[ffebad]Warrior, here's your medicine. Alas, Chati's situation is really, I'm really worried. The teacher, too, left in a hurry without saying a word about where he was going. Now someone has malicious intentions, maybe they will threaten the teacher. [-]

[ffebad]Lord Karaqiu, who is that strange man? [-]

[ffebad]He is my brother Callahan. He is the first man in history to inherit Peorista. He is a very good magician, but he violated the taboo and violated the reputation of Peorista. Until now, he still looks unrepentant! [-]
