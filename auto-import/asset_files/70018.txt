step 1
1
[ffebad]This matter must be thoroughly investigated! [-]
1
[ffebad]The surviving monster captive said something about [0096ff] Childe[-], you go and find out what Childe is. [-]

step 2
1
[ffebad](frightened) is, is it you? What do you want to do, I have told you all I know. [-]
[branch]3=Child? |3=Oh? |3=Really?

step 3
1
[ffebad]Yes, yes... I am Childe who stands above humans! [-]
1
[ffebad]You wounded me, [0096ff] Goddess Vestine [-] will not let you go! [-]
[branch]4=Say it clearly! |4=Vestine? |4=Who are you? !

step 4
1
[ffebad]I am the child of the goddess Vestine, Chard who is always loyal to the goddess! [-]
[branch]5=(Listen carefully)

step 5
1
[ffebad]Childe was originally a human from the Mysterious Continent. We were chosen by the goddess Vestine, and we planted the seeds of [0096ff] hatred[-] and [0096ff] pain[-] in our hearts. [-]
1
[ffebad]These seeds hatch in our bodies and become powerful forces for our use. [-]
1
[ffebad]This kind of power makes us stand out as human beings! [-]
1
[ffebad]Even, we Childe can [0096ff] devour each other[-], absorbing the strength of other Childe's bodies. [-]
[branch]6=It's cruel

step 6
1
[ffebad]Haha, survival of the fittest is cruel only for you puny humans. [-]
1
[ffebad]The mighty Chard may even [0096ff] take the form of a dragon[-], an immortal being between heaven and earth. [-]
[branch]7=Dragon? !

step 7
1
[ffebad]Not bad! With a child, you can become a [0096ff] ice dragon[-]! [-]
1
[ffebad]However, I heard that it gave its ice dragon jade [0096ff] to others [-]. How stupid to waste so much power. [-]

step 8
1
[ffebad]I see, it seems that Childe is a monster from [0096ff] Mysterious Continent[-], why is this monster so powerful...[-]
1
[ffebad]What the hell is going on in the Land of Mystery, how did the goddess Vestine create such evil creatures? [-]
[branch]9=Hate and pain|10=Happiness and joy|10=Don't know!

step 9
1
[ffebad]The Goddess sowed the seeds of hatred and pain in the hearts of human beings and created Childe, but why are these Childe so much stronger than human beings?
[branch]10=Don't eat|11=Eat each other|10=Don't know!

step 10
1
[ffebad]Your survey results are not up to par, go and hear what that Childe has to say. [0096ff] Seriously [-]! [-]

step 11
1
[ffebad]I have a general understanding of what the Chard created by the goddess Vestine is, so what is the ice dragon?
[branch]10=Devil|12=Powerful Chard|10=I don't know!

step 12
1
[ffebad]It turns out that the ice dragon is a kind of Chard...a monster created by the goddess Vestine, who can actually turn into a dragon. [-]
1
[ffebad]This matter is of great importance, adventurer, are you willing to investigate Ice Dragon and Chard for the Holy Paradise to enter the Mysterious Continent? [-]
[branch]13=very honored|14=unwilling

step 13
1
[ffebad]You are the warrior in my heart, let's go adventurer! [-]

step 14
1
[ffebad]If you reject me, I don't know who else can complete this task. [-]
break

step 15
1
[ffebad]You saved the humans in the Mysterious Continent, well done. Go and inquire about the situation. [-]
