[ffebad] who are you? His Excellency Pope Tramay? [-]

[ffebad] Hehe, I can actually recognize the old man. I've heard a lot about you from that vicious traitor, and though we've all been misled by him, there's no question that you're a true hero of good. In the future, I hope you can help me a lot. [-]

[ffebad] Ah! So what did I see? [-]

[ffebad] I think what you saw was indeed Barna, but now it is the death knight Barna. It's really sad. After the death of a great hero, he was turned into an undead creature by evil forces. I came here this time to mourn Karaqiu, and also to prevent Barna from being used by evil forces... [-]

[ffebad] Damn it, it turned out to be like this, I will definitely help you prevent this from happening! It's just that Barna doesn't know where to go now. [-]

[ffebad] Hehe, hope will not be cut off. You can go to the Recovery Forest. When you come back, I will tell you how we got the news. You will be very happy. The Goddess' compassionate care is always with us. [-]
