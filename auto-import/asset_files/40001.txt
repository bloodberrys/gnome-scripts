[ffebad]Priestess of Darkness, I can actually use the power of darkness in my dream, but in my dream I was almost swallowed by that darkness, do you know what is going on? [-]

[ffebad]How could this be, I can absorb the darkness of the goddess. [-]

[ffebad]Of course, I can also help you dissolve the poison of corruption, but the dark power you have absorbed will also disappear. Well, if you can't make up your mind, just find a place to think about it first, I'll wait for you here. [-]
