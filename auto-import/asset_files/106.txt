[ffebad]When you went to see Siddell, we were also investigating. Although we don't have the power of dragons, there may be other ways to curb the evil curse on Barna. It is said that long, long ago, in this land , the ancients had wars, and the kind ancients would purify those corrupted ancients. [-]

[ffebad]Yes, the ancients used a treasure called the mirror of truth. It is said that as long as you look at the mirror of truth, it will reflect the false appearance and absorb the unreal appearance. Perhaps the evil power that manipulated Barna could be locked in the mirror as well. [-]
